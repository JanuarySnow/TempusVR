TESTING BUILD FOR TEMPUS MALEDICTUM VR

known issues:

current build of Community Shaders dosnt show the skyrim logo on bootup, youll just get a black screen until the main menu loads, this can take minutes
it takes around 20 seconds after pressing new game for character creation to show, on my machine

Community shaders can make areas show bright light and colors for a while after an area loads

Some distant lods for fallen tree logs are purple, cant work out why, not a huge priority for a testing build

It boots, it dosnt crash anymore when travelling around and doing various things, beyond that ive not tested it much, I would like more testing and issues to be logged on this github

optionals:

Opencomposite is turned on by default
FSR is turned on by default in community shaders profile, if you have nvidia card capable of DLAA you can turn that on instead 
community shaders menu is opened with HOME key

Performance:

I get around 60 fps on a 4070ti on virtual desktop medium resolution
So I set it to 90 hz with SSW turned on to make it 45/90

Dont ask Lively for help, ping me in livelys server - @januarysnow .
