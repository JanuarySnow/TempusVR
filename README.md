TESTING BUILD FOR TEMPUS MALEDICTUM VR

THIS REQUIRES SKYRIM AE DLC JUST LIKE TEMPUS DOES, IT AUTOMATICALLY SOURCES FROM AE INSTALL ON YOUR PC AND CONVERTS IT FOR USE IN SKYRIMVR

install the modlist, open the modlist install folder, run modorganizer.exe

Click "PLAY Tempus VR" at the top of Mo2 to launch the game

known issues:

The wabbajack file itself is 5GB, this is very large, cant be avoided, due to parallaxgen output, it will take a long time to download when you select it in the gallery.

current build of Community Shaders dosnt show the skyrim logo on bootup, youll just get a black screen until the main menu loads, this can take minutes

it also takes around 20 seconds after pressing new game for character creation to show, on my machine

Community shaders can make areas show bright light and colors for a while after an area loads

It boots, it dosnt crash anymore when travelling around and doing various things, beyond that ive not tested it much, I would like more testing and issues to be logged on this github

optionals:

Opencomposite is turned on by default
FSR is turned on by default in community shaders profile, if you have nvidia card capable of DLAA you can turn that on instead 
community shaders menu is opened with HOME key

Performance:

I get around 60 fps on a 4070ti on virtual desktop medium resolution
So I set it to 90 hz with SSW turned on to make it 45/90

Dont ask Lively for help, ping me in livelys server - @januarysnow . 

general info for Tempus can be found here : https://github.com/LivelyDismay/tempus-maledictum 

But quite a few things are changed

Controls are the base VR essentials are from FUS : https://github.com/Kvitekvist/FUS/wiki/Controller-bindings-guide

I use kvites bindings

This is an early testing build, please log issues on this repo
